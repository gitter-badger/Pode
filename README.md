Pode is a PowerShell web framework that runs HTTP/TCP listeners on specific ports, allowing you to host [REST APIs](#rest-api), [Web Pages](#web-pages) and [SMTP/TCP](#smtp-server) servers. It also allows you to render dynamic files using [Pode](#pode-files) files, which is effectively embedded PowerShell, or other [Third-Party](#third-party-view-engines) template engines.

## Documentation

This documentation will cover the basics on how to use Pode to create a simple REST API, Web Page, and SMTP Server. Further examples can be found in the examples folder.

### Setup

Pode has a couple of useful commands that you can use on the CLI, to help you initialise, start, test, build, or install any packages for your repo. These commands all utilise the `package.json` structure - as seen in Node and Yarn.

> At the moment, Pode only uses the `start`, `test`, `build` and `install` properties of the `scripts` section in your `package.json`. You can still have others, like `dependencies` for Yarn

```powershell
# similar to yarn and node, init will help you create a new package.json
pode init

# if you have a "start" script this will run that property; otherwise will run the script in "main"
pode start

# if you have a "test" script this will run that property
pode test

# if you have a "install" script this will run that property
pode install

# if you have a "build" script this will run that property
pode build
```

> By default, Pode will pre-populate `test`, `build` and `install` using `yarn`, `psake` and `pester` respectively

Following is an example `package.json`

```json
{
    "name":  "example",
    "description":  "",
    "version":  "1.0.0",
    "main":  "./file.ps1",
    "scripts":  {
        "start":  "./file.ps1",
        "test":  "invoke-pester ./tests/*.ps1",
        "install":  "yarn install --force --ignore-scripts --modules-folder pode_modules",
        "build": "psake"
    },
    "author":  "",
    "license":  "MIT"
}
```

### Docker

This is an example of using Docker to host your Pode scripts, using the `examples/web-pages.ps1` example from the examples directory. Below is an example `Dockerfile` to pull down the base container image, copy over the example files and then run the website (assuming this is run from the examples directory):

```dockerfile
# File: Dockerfile
FROM badgerati/pode
COPY . /usr/src/app/
EXPOSE 8085
CMD [ "pwsh", "-c", "cd /usr/src/app; ./web-pages-docker.ps1" ]
```

To run build and run this, use the following commands:

```bash
docker build -t pode-example .
docker run -p 8085:8085 -d pode-example
```

Now try navigating to `localhost:8085` (or calling `curl localhost:8085`) and you should be greeted with a "Hello, world!" page.

### Frontend

You can host web-pages using Pode, and to help you can also use package managers like `yarn` to help install frontend libraries (like bootstrap).

```powershell
choco install yarn -y
yarn init
yarn add bootstrap
```

When run, Pode will tell `yarn` to install the packages to a `pode_modules` directory. Other useful packages could include `gulp`, `lodash`, `moment`, etc.

### Basics

Pode, at its heart, is a PowerShell module. In order to use Pode, you'll need to start off your script by importing it:

```powershell
Import-Module Pode
```

After that, all of your main server logic must be wrapped in a `Server` block. This lets you specify port numbers, server type, and any key logic: (you can only have one `Server` declared in your script)

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    # logic
}
```

The above `Server` block will start a basic HTTP listener on port 8080. Once started, to exit out of Pode at anytime just use `Ctrl+C`.

### Timers

Timers are supported in all `Server` types, they are async processes that run in a separate runspace along side your main server logic. The following are a few examples of using timers, more can be found in `examples/timers.ps1`:

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    # runs forever, looping every 5secs
    timer 'forever' 5 {
        # logic
    }

    # run once after 2mins
    timer 'run-once' 120 {
        # logic
    } -skip 1 -limit 1

    # create a new timer via a route
    route 'get' '/api/timer' {
        param($session)
        $query = $session.Query

        timer $query['Name'] $query['Seconds'] {
            # logic
        }
    }
}
```

> All timers are created and run within the same runspace, one after another when their trigger time occurs. You should ensure that a timer's defined logic does not take a long time to process (things like heavy database tasks or reporting), as this will delay other timers from being run. For timers that might take a much longer time to run, use an Interval Server type (`Server -Interval 60 { ... }`)

### REST API

When creating an API in Pode, you specify logic for certain routes for specific HTTP methods. Methods supported are: DELETE, GET, HEAD, MERGE, OPTIONS, PATCH, POST, PUT, and TRACE.

The method to create new routes is `route`, this will take your method, route, and logic. For example, let's say you want a basic GET `ping` endpoint to just return `pong`:

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    route 'get' '/api/ping' {
        param($session)
        json @{ 'value' = 'pong'; }
    }
}
```

The scriptblock requires a `param` section for just one argument: `$session`. This argument will contain the `Request` and `Response` objects; `Data` (from POST), and the `Query` (from the query string of the URL), as well as any `Parameters` from the route itself (eg: `/:accountId`).

The last line is to write the JSON response. Anyone hitting `http://localhost:8080/api/ping` will be greeted back with `{ "value": "pong" }`.

If you wanted a POST endpoint that created a user, and a GET endpoint to get details of a user (returning a 404 if the user isn't found), then it would roughly look as follows:

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    route 'post' '/api/users' {
        param($session)

        # create the user
        $userId = New-DummyUser $session.Data.Email $session.Data.Name $session.Data.Password

        # return with userId
        json @{ 'userId' = $userId; }
    }

    route 'get' '/api/users/:userId'{
        param($session)

        # get the user
        $user = Get-DummyUser -UserId $session.Parameters['userId']

        # return the user
        if ($user -eq $null) {
            status 404
        }
        else {
            json @{ 'user' = $user; }
        }
    }
}
```

> More can be seen in the examples under `rest-api.ps1`, and `nunit-rest-api.ps1`

### Web Pages

It's actually possible for Pode to serve up webpages - css, fonts, and javascript included. They pretty much work exactly like the above REST APIs, except Pode has inbuilt logic to handle css/javascript and other files.

Pode also has its own format for writing dynamic HTML pages. There are examples in the example directory, but in general they allow you to dynamically generate HTML, CSS or any file type using embedded PowerShell.

All static and dynamic HTML content *must* be placed within a `/views/` directory, which is in the same location as your Pode script. In here you can place your view files, so when you call the `view` function in Pode, it will automatically look in the `/views/` directory. For example, if you call `view 'simple'` then Pode will look for `/views/simple.html`. Likewise for `/views/main/simple.html` if you pass `'main/simple'` instead.

> Pode uses a View Engine to either render HTML, Pode, or other types. Default is HTML, and you can change it to Pode by calling `engine pode` at the top of your Server scriptblock

Any other file types, from css to javascript, fonts and images, must all be placed within a `/public/` directory - again, in the same location as your Pode script. Here, when Pode sees a request for a path with a file extension, it will automatically look for that path in the `/public/` directory. For example, if you reference `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles/simple.css">` in your HTML file, then Pode will look for `/public/styles/simple.css`.

A quick example of a single page site on port 8085:

```powershell
Server -Port 8085 {
    # default view engine is already HTML, so following can left out
    engine html

    route 'get' '/' {
        param($session)
        view 'simple'
    }
}
```

> This can be seen in the examples under `web-pages.ps1`

### SMTP Server

Pode can also run as an SMTP server - useful for mocking tests. There are two options, you can either use Pode's inbuilt simple SMTP logic, or write your own using Pode as a TCP server instead.

If you're using Pode's unbuilt SMTP logic, then you need to state so when creating the server: `Server -Smtp`. This will automatically create a TCP listener on port 25 (unless you pass a different port number).

Unlike with HTTP Routes, TCP and SMTP can only have one handler. To create a handler for the inbuilt logic:

```powershell
Server -Smtp {
    handler 'smtp' {
        param($session)
        Write-Host $session.From
        Write-Host $session.To
        Write-Host $session.Data
    }
}
```

The SMTP Handler will be passed a session already populated with the `From` address, the single or multiple `To` addresses, and the raw `Data` of the mail body.

> This can be seen in the examples under `mail-server.ps1`

If you want to create you own SMTP server, then you'll need to set Pode up as a TCP listener and manually read the SMTP stream yourself:

```powershell
Server -Tcp -Port 25 {
    handler 'tcp' {
        param($session)
        $client = $session.Client
        # your stream writing/reading here
    }
}
```

To help with writing and reading from the client stream, Pode has a helper function with two actions for `read` and `write`:

* `tcp write $msg`
* `$msg = (tcp read)`

## Pode Files

Using Pode to write dynamic HTML files are mostly just an HTML file - in fact, you can write pure HTML and still be able to use it. The difference is that you're able to embed PowerShell logic into the file, which allows you to dynamically generate HTML.

To use Pode files, you will need to place them within the `/views/` folder. Then you'll need to set the View Engine to be Pode; once set, you can just write view responses as per normal:

> Any PowerShell in a Pode files will need to use semi-colons to end each line

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    # set the engine to use and render Pode files
    engine pode

    # render the index.pode view
    route 'get' '/' {
        param($session)
        view 'index'
    }
}
```

Below is a basic example of a Pode file which just writes the current date to the browser:

```html
<!-- /views/index.pode -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Current Date</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <span>$([DateTime]::Now.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');)</span>
    </body>
</html>
```

> When you need to use PowerShell, ensure you wrap the commands within `$(...)`, and end each line with a semi-colon (as you would in C#/Java)

You can also supply data to the `view` function when rendering Pode files. This allows you to make them far more dynamic. The data supplied to `view` must be a `hashtable`, and can be referenced within the file by using the `$data` argument.

For example, say you need to render a search page which is a list of accounts, then you're basic Pode script would look like:

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    # set the engine to use and render Pode files
    engine pode

    # render the search.pode view
    route 'get' '/' {
        param($session)

        # some logic to get accounts
        $query = $session.Query['query']
        $accounts = Find-Account -Query $query

        # render the file
        view 'search' -Data @{ 'query' = $query; 'accounts' = $accounts; }
    }
}
```

You can see that we're supplying the found accounts to the `view` function as a `hashtable`. Next, we see the `search.pode` file which generates the HTML:

```html
<!-- /views/search.pode -->
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Search</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Search</h1>
        Query: $($data.query;)

        <div>
            $(foreach ($account in $data.accounts) {
                "<div>Name: $($account.Name)</div><hr/>";
            })
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

> Remember, you can access supplied data by using `$data`

This next quick example allows you to include content from another view:

```html
<!-- /views/index.pode -->
<html>
    $(include shared/head)

    <body>
        <span>$([DateTime]::Now.ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss');)</span>
    </body>
</html>

<!-- /views/shared/head.pode -->
<head>
    <title>Include Example</title>
</head>
```

### Non-View Pode Files

The rules for using Pode files for other types, like public css/js, work exactly like the above view files but they're placed within the `/public/` directory instead of the `/views/` directory. You also need to special the actual file type in the extension, for example:

```plain
/public/styles/main.css.pode
/public/scripts/main.js.pode
```

Here you'll see the main extension is `pode`, but you need to specify a sub-extension of the main file type - this helps Pode work out the main content type.

Below is a `.css.pode` file that will render the page in purple on even seconds, or red on odd seconds:

```css
/* /public/styles/main.css.pode */
body {
    $(
        $date = [DateTime]::UtcNow;

        if ($date.Second % 2 -eq 0) {
            "background-color: rebeccapurple;";
        } else {
            "background-color: red;";
        }
    )
}
```

## Third-Party View Engines

Pode also supports the use of third-party view engines, for example you could use the [EPS](https://github.com/straightdave/eps) template engine. To do this, you'll need to supply a custom scriptblock to `Engine` which tells Pode how use the third-party engine.

If you did use `EPS`, then the following example would work:

```powershell
Server -Port 8080 {
    # set the engine to use and render EPS files (could be index.eps, or for content scripts.css.eps)
    # the scriptblock requires the "param($path, $data)"
    engine eps {
        param($path, $data)
        return Invoke-EpsTemplate -Path $path -Binding $data
    }

    # render the index.eps view
    route 'get' '/' {
        param($session)
        view 'index'
    }
}
```
